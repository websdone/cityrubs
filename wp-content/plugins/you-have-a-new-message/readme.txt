Notify users about new BuddyPress messages (widget & shortcode)

== Description ==

This plugin is as simple as it is useful. Add the widget or use the shortcode `[you-have-a-new-message]` anywhere to display a notice if the currently logged in user has new messages. The notice links to the user's inbox as a convenient and omnipresent shortcut.

Message texts can be configured via widget interface and shortcode parameters, e.g. `[you-have-a-new-message single="new message" multiple="%s new messages"]`.
